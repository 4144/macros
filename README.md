## Commonly used C macros

This is a collection of commonly used C Macros I found on internet, and as suggested by my friends.

### How to use

Just download macros.h from [here](https://github.com/ramdeoshubham/macros/archive/master.zip) and include it to the top.

```C
#include "macro.h"
```
The source is very clear and the macros availble are too common you will find them everywhere. They need no explaination.

They might have some exception errors, please correct if you find any. Also, if I missed some interesting ones, please add those to make this list complete.
